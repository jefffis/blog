title: 'Give a shit: Design & designers are killing the web.'
---

We designers are trying our damndest to kill the web. And we've been doing it since web design became a thing. Think about this: the responsive web is **something we had to make because we broke it**. The web, in its very own nature is responsive. Try it out: [disable the CSS](https://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/ydn/temporarily-disable-css-testing-53538.html) & [JavaScript](http://www.alanwood.net/demos/enabling-javascript.html) in your broser and see. Albeit it may not have been the most attractive to consume, but when it was born, the web adapted naturally to browsers of all sizes and shapes.

But then us designers decided this was silly, and ugly, and not good enough. So we **fixed it**. And, for the last 20 or so years we've been creating headaches and fussing over pixels for reasons we essentially created. We only knew, and know now, that it's not good enough as the web was meant to be.

## But Tim Berners-Lee a designer was not

True, he was not. But, not all problems can be, or should be solved, by designers (I know, crazy that I would suggest this!). By this I mean that the web was built for information consumption and sharing. It was not built for pixel perfection, media queries sniffing, parallax scrolljacking, retina jargon, etc... As the Information Architects quipped so eloquently, [the web is 95% typography](https://ia.net/know-how/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period). So why does it feel like we designers are pushing our users away from tried and true web design paradigms that work???

## Underline all the links

Yes, text underlines. Not sexy, not new, not painted in the DOM by JavaScript. Nothing. Just plain ol' <code>text-decoration: underline</code>. Simple yes? Yes it is. You might be asking yourself, that's too simple. Too boring, too this, too that, not snazzy enough, underlines are for old people, etc...

Yes, you are correct here too. Text hyperlinks are not sexy. But, they are instantly, even annoyingly so, recognizable as exactly what they are: hyperlinks. By removing these underlines, the web-old paradigm of exactly what is text and exactly what is a link is lost. We are then asking, nay, forcing our users to re-learn this for our website. Sure, some sites that an insane amount of traffic might be able to get away with this (think <code>google.com</code>), but their users go to their site thousands upon thousands of times in their lives, and I'll just give them a pass.

However, <code>google.com</code> you are not, and <code>google.com</code> I am not. So, every time we re-style our hyperlinks in some clever way, we are, digitally, flipping our users the bird. By removing these base styles we not only force our user to figure out that links are not underlined, we force them to learn a new way that we've styled them, and then we also force them to spend mental energy on figuring out what is a link and what is not a link. Unless your users efforts, time, and money means nothing to you, then I hope you can see the error of our ways here.

## Old and/or less privileged users of the do exist

And, they are probably going to become more prevalant as baby boomers become more familiar with the web, and most importantly, as the web continues to expand into the third world. **And what does this mean for designers?** A LOT. It means we are the gatekeepers as well as the keymasters. It means we hold all the power in terms of whether a user succeeds in what they want to do, or whether they get frustrated and give us, ne'er to return again. 4G retina screens may be popular in urban areas of some first world countries, but by and large, the way users connect to the internet they are not seeing five thousand pixels crammed into a shiny new Mac. So, when we remove our text underlines, for older users, or users on shitty computers, we make it even harder to do whatever they came to us to do.

## Give a shit

So, please, for the webs sake; **give a shit about your users**. They don't need that overzealous parallax effect, or that 4MB image, and they certainly don't need to spend energy to figure out what is a link and what is not. Also remember; unlimited data plans are dying, and we need to care about what we take from our users, not just what we give to them.

Stay tuned for part two of **Giving a shit about your users**. [Head back home](/).
